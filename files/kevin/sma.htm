      schools have tended to lag, making do with old pictures and old texts, 
      influencing young minds towards their standards. Yet there is a superb 
      carved wooden door in the Roman Catholic Church at Ibadan. Rows of squat, 
      dark, almost ugly yet strangely impressive figures perform their ritual 
      actions. Mary pounds fufu among her father's hens as the angel approaches. 
      The disciples and the ass's colt of Palm Sunday are clearly recognizable 
      yet different. The door is made by Yoruba craftsmen, and clearly there is 
      a great tradition of door carving. How did it happen?'<BR></I><BR>

      The door produced by Lamidi Fakeye in 1954 is one example of some hundreds 
      of carvings produced by a group of carvers who have, since 1947, been 
      directing their traditional skill to new purposes. In this book I intend 
      to describe the work of several of these carvers and of others who have 
      worked in Nigeria or Dahomey during the last seventy years, relating their 
      work to its environment as it changes from the closed community life of 
      the last century to the wide-eyed and turbulent life of today.<BR>

      <IMG height=220 src="sma_files/carrol.jpg" width=150 align=right><BR>In 
      1946, Father Patrick Kelly, Provincial Superior of the Irish Province of 
      the Society of African Missions, decided to establish a center to study, 
      among other things, the adaptation of African crafts to Christian uses, 
      and to experiment in this field. Early in 1947, he chose a small town in 
      north-east Yoruba country named Oye <I>Ekiti </I>as the site of this 
      center.<BR>When Father Sean O'Mahoney and I had settled in the town we 
      soon became conscious of the pagan liturgical year, for everyone - Pagan, 
      Christian and Moslem - was familiar with it and could describe it in 
      detail.<BR>

      <HR>
      Early in 1947 we began to employ men and women who were skilled in the 
      various crafts. The women wove ornamental cloths for church fabrics on 
      their upright broadlooms, using African techniques and patterns. The men 
      worked on their narrow looms to produce the more difficult patterns 
      required for orphreys. We also engaged beadworkers eatherworkers and 
      woodcarvers.<BR><I>Johnson Esan, </I>the first carver who worked for us, 
      came from Orin about eight miles away. He had carved 'angels' for 
      Monsignor <I>Julius Onih, </I>one of the first Yoruba Catholic priests. We 
      found Esan's work to be of poor quality by Yoruba standards. We also asked 
      a young carver known as Sam, a native of <I>Efon Alaye </I>to carve for 
      us, but his father died and he soon had to return home. Then <I>Bandele 
      </I>presented himself for work. He is the son of one of the greatest known 
      African carvers, <I>Areogun </I>of <I>Osi florid </I>who died in 1954. 
      Bandele was at that time in his late thirties. Now, nineteen years later, 
      he is still working for me and I will describe his work in some 
detail.<BR>
      <HR>
      <FONT color=blue size=4><B>Bandele's history</FONT></FONT></B> 
      <HR>
      Bandele was a Catholic, baptized 'George' by Monsignor Onih, but he had 
      little knowledge of the Catholic religion. He came to church on some of 
      the bigger feast days—if not otherwise occupied. The first work we asked 
      him to make was a Madonna and child because mother and child carvings are 
      common in Yoruba tradition. I suggested that the figure be dressed in the 
      long dress and veil such as nuns wear. Whether or not we should have asked 
      him to carve Mary like any other Yoruba woman is discussed in another 
      context. Bandele produced a poor and indecisive work.<BR>A second attempt 
      was no better and several trials were made before we had any success. The 
      break-through came when we tried a different approach.

      <HR>
      <IMG height=170 src="sma_files/crib.jpg" width=260 align=left><BR>Bandele 
      was asked to carve a Christmas crib set with the figures of Mary and 
      child, Joseph and the wise men. He was to start with the wise men 
      represented according to the apocryphal tradition as three kings. The 
      kings were to be carved like the kings in Yoruba house-posts. Bandele 
      produced three kings in a firm Yoruba style, and then carved the Christian 
      figures in the same style. Various other works followed—further crib—sets 
      for local churches, large figures for outdoor shrines, crucifixes and 
      stations of the cross (these are sets of fourteen panels relating the 
      Passion of Christ). We would ask a Christian to tell the stories to 
      Bandele and would then discuss the details of the carving with him - Us it 
      was not possible to leave him entirely to his own resources. For example, 
      Bandele suggested that he should represent screws in the crucifix rather 
      than nails as they were stronger.<BR>

      thinkers</FONT></FONT></B> 
      <HR>
      Emile Male, great expert on the Christian Gothic art of Europe, has 
      written: 'When iconography is transformed, when art adapts new themes it 
      is because a thinker has collaborated with the artists. Suger was one of 
      these men who set art on new ways....' In our own smaller way we tried to 
      repeat the influence of a Suger, although the full flowering of African 
      Christian art will require tile guidance of African religious thinkers.
