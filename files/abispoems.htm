    <font color="green"> Dragon</font>
    </u>
    <p>
    
  <font color="red">
    The dragon lies sleeping,<br>
    His body slouched like a small mountain,<br>
    He awakes <br>
    And slinks up the hillside,<br>
    To stand majestically, guarding.<p>
  </font>
  <font color="green">
    His body is a scarlet steam engine,<br>
    Glistening in the sunlight,<br>
    His legs are thick tree trunks covered in blood,<br>
    His eyes are two sparkling lakes,<br>
    Two smouldering volcanoes for nostrils.<p>
  </font>
  <font color="brown">
    Breathing fire as he signals,<br>
    As he stands on the boarder ,<br>
    As a warning to all enemies,<br>
    Guarding and protecting his country.<br>

  <font color="brown">
    My Grandad is the Tickle Tiger,<br>
    When we're naughty, <br>
    He tickles and tickles,<br>
    Until we cry for mercy.<p>
  </font>
  <font color="red">
    All the time he's writing poems,<br>
    Reading newspapers,<br>
    And watching football, <br>
    Or cricket. <p>
  </font>
  <font color="navy">
    My Grandads cheeks,<br>
    Are like small hedgehogs,<br>
    And his hair is like a pale yellow mop head.<p>
  </font>
  <font color="green">
    My Grandad tells me, <br>
    About world war II,<br>
    Down in the mines,<br>
    And out on the sea.<p>
  </font>
  <font color="purple">
    My Grandads legs,<br>
    Are all wibbly wobbly,<br>
    He can't go any where,<br>
    Without his stick.<p>
