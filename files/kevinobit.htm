<b>IRISH TIMES,   February 4th, 1993<br>
APPRECIATION: Father Kevin Carroll, S.M.A.</b><p>
The Society of African Missions lost one of its most outstanding 
members on the death of Father Kevin Carroll in Ibadan, Nigeria, 
on January 12th. In the course of his fifty years in Ghana and Nigeria,
 he became an internationally recognised expert on Africa's arts, its 
 crafts and culture. He died aged 72 on the eve of the celebration of
  the golden jubilee of his ordination.
<p>
It is appropriate that his life should have come to a close in the second
 largest purely African city, dominated as it is by Yoruba energy and talent.
  Kevin died amongst people whose mind and aesthetic he understood and whose 
  language he spoke and wrote with delicacy and perfection. He died too amongst 
  members of the society which had the vision to give his talents the scope 
  they needed.
<p>

Kevin Carroll was a native of Liverpool, the eldest of an outstandingly talented
 family. His interest in African art began in childhood visits to the museum in 
 Liverpool with its fine collection of African carvings. In Ghana where he taught
  at St. Augustine's Cape Coast, as well as acquiring the Fante language, he learnt
   about pattern-weaving from a native Ashanti craftsman and integrated local carvers
    into the teaching resources. In the past these crafts were often so closely
     associated with paganism that such initiatives got little encouragement from 
     older missionaries.
<p>
During his long career Kevin found time to produce two very important books, 
Yoruba Religious Carving - subtitled Pagan and Christian Sculpture in Nigeria 
and Dahomey (Geoffrey Chapman, London 1967)  followed 25 years later by Architectures
 of Nigeria, (Ethnographica Ltd. London 1992) The first describes the initial projects
  in which, with Father Sean O'Mahony SMA, available sources of skill were identified 
  and the carvers and weavers, smiths, bead and leather workers organised in a new and
   purposeful way.
<p>
This was a period during which Nigerian critical opinion was taking shape. 
A number of expatriate commentators were voicing somewhat over-heated opinions 
in response to the fashionable pre-occupation with n&eacute;gritude in the arts as, 
for example, at the Dakar Festival of Negro Arts of 1966 - not least Andr&eacute; Malraux's
 quasi-obituary there on African traditional art.
<p>
Kevin was keenly aware of these trends of opinion. His own views - and he had read 
everything - were both positive and down to earth; no lack of sensibility, lots of 
sense and everything directed towards the perpetuation of a living artistic idiom.
<P>
Kevin's second quarter century made him master of other Nigerian languages - 
Hausa, Kamberi and Tiv - and led to the publication of his Architectures of Nigeria.
<p>
I was privileged to have known Kevin Carroll and to have had the evidence of eyes 
and ears for the presence in the world of a great stayer and an achiever. The books
 are there for all to see and one hopes they will be sought out and read. A part of
  Kevin's achievement will remain hidden in the hearts of ordinary Nigerian people,
   animist, Muslim and Christian.
<p>
The vast throng attending his funeral Mass and burial in Oke-Are, Ibadan, paid 
eloquent tribute to a man who spent his entire missionary career in their midst,
 someone moreover whose scholarship and artistic vision had embellished their 
 lives and made their churches part of a cultural continuum.
