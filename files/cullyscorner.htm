        <p>We've come from Ross; t'was very far;<br>
          We've reached the Llyn Peninsular.<br>
          Our camp site's high above the beach,<br>
          But one that is in easy reach<br>
          Of Aberdaron by the sea. </p>
        <p> Down winding path to shoreline clean<br>
          No crowds, no trippers mar the scene.<br>
          We wend our way to hear the roar<br>
          As wave on wave beat on the shore. 
        <p> The sea, the sea, it beckons me;<br>
          I cannot funk it, for you seem<br>
          I have my costume here with me;<br>
          So de trop in ' 43,<br>
          Well darned and patched around the knee. 
        <p> I make my way across the rocks,<br>
          Made tougher still by lack of socks,<br>
          Then, bidding fond farewell to Mij,<br>
          I plunge into this foaming fridge. 
        <p> I fight with all the strength within,<br>
          Until the waves caress my chin;<br>
          Then pick me up with one big roar<br>
          And fling me back upon the shore.<br>
          Experience teaches , so they say,<br>
          But I'll be back another day.

          <a href="../pages/colmandmargaret/pithead.jpg"><img src="../pages/colmandmargaret/thms/thm_pithead.jpg" width="101" height="113" border="0" alt="Colm revisiting the pithead"></a><br>
          I was due to go into the army but so many miners had been called up 
          for the army and the country needed so much coal that I was sent to 
          be a miner instead of a soldier.<br>
          <br>
          I was sent to Derbyshire in May 1944 to do my training. We had just 
          six weeks to train. When we were finished we were sent to different 
          mines or collieries. I was taken to my "digs" with another young man 
          and we had experience at the pit top sorting different sizes of coal. 
          This lasted two weeks and was very boring and very, very, noisy.<br>
          <br>
          Next we had to go down the mine. There I was shown how to couple the 
          trucks of coal which came from the coal face. The coal face was about 
          a quarter of a mile from the pit bottom. We each had a lamp hooked onto 
          our belts and we wore helmets to protect our heads from falling rock 
          and from banging our heads on the very low roofs. It is just as well 
          I was wearing a helmet one day because I was knocked out by a huge piece 
          of coal that fell off a conveyer belt. All I remember was waking up 
          to the smell of Dettol. I still bear a black scar behind my ear.<br>
          <br>
          Some of the time I had to move heavy rails and although I wore thick 
          gloves the palms of my hands peeled. Eventually I got quite used to 
          working without gloves at all. <br>
          <br>
          We worked from 7am. to 2.30pm. with a quarter of an hour for "snap" 
          which was what lunch was called. My landlady put my lunch in a box but 
          it was a very dirty place to eat. There was no place to wash underground 
          and no toilets. <br>
          <br>
          When we arrived for work we collected our lamps and a "tally". This 
          was a metal "ticket" with your own number on it. When you got to the 
          bottom of the pit shaft you handed it in and it was hung on a board. 
          This way it was always known who was down in the pit. This might be 
          very important if there was an accident. <br>
          <br>
          The "cage", which the lift was called, held about ten men and went down 
          to the bottom at such speed that you thought your stomach was going 
          to come out of your mouth.<br>
          <br>
          For some time I was in charge of a pit pony. I had to go down to a part 
          of the mine where the roof was falling in. I had to put new wooden pit 
          props in and take the old ones out and back to the pit bottom. One day 
          when we were having snap the old miner I was working with hung the lamps 
          on the back of the "tub" or wagon. The pony, which was harnessed to 
          the tub, took fright at something and bolted back to his stable taking 
          the lamps with him and leaving us in pitch darkness. I had to feel my 
          way, doubled up because the roof was so low, until I found the pony 
          again. He had stopped when he had come to a screen.<br>
          <br>
          When my shift finished I always took the pony back to its underground 
          stall. It was fed on hay and given water. The ponies stayed down most 
          of the time and were only brought up during holiday time.</p>
        <p>Ours was a modern pit and there were showers for us when we finished 
          our shifts. Coal dust got into every part of you, even into the corners 
          of your eyes. It took a few days away from the pit for you to be really 
          clean. When we came in for our morning shift we had to change into our 
          dirty clothes. These were given a wash every two weeks. You got used 
          to getting in to dirty clothes.</p>
        <p>I was in the mines for three and a half years and was glad I did not 
          have to stay in for ever.</p>
        <p> Three years ago I was on holiday in Derbyshire and went to see what 
          had happened to the mine I had spent so much time in. The colliery had 
          shut down and all that was left was the pit head and the big wheel that 
          ran the cages and the ventilation. </p>

          And where d'ya think I got them from? <br>
          Why, dear old Harry Tuffin's.</p>
        <p> I bought a two pound chicken once <br>

          From whence it came you can't go wrong <br>
          Why dear old Harry Tuffin.</p>
        <p> Ann bought a bike for exercise<br>

          But now she is so very fit - <br>
          Its thanks to Harry Tuffin. </p>
        <p>Paul's juggling is coming on,<br>
          Which also leaves him puffin. <br>
          Of course he bought his juggling kit <br>
          From noble Harry Tuffin. </p>
        <p>The Royal Household sent out cards <br>
          To rich and those with nuffin; <br>

          Noble Harry Tuffin. </p>
        <p>Sad to say this very morn<br>
          I heard some mournful news <br>
          That noble Harry Tuffin<br>
          Was dead beneath the yews.</p>
        <p> His gravestone was a granite block,<br>

          His relatives had bought the plot <br>

          I've heard the registers ring out <br>
          When taking lots of cash <br>
          And by and large I tell with pride <br>
          I'll even tell the puffins; <br>
          There is no other shop on earth <br>
