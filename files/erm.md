'erms' taken out of the interviews with Phil. 
She was doing a project which involved photographing our hands 
a lot and then interviewing us individually on 'our place in 
the family and views on Irish history'. 
She edited the recordings and took the 'erms' out. 
Damo suggested she make files from these out-takes as they 
were so funny. Click on a photo to play the clip. 
These are only 10 second clips from the original 3 to 4 
minute out-takes.
