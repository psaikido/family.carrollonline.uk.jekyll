<p align="left">' erms' taken out of the interviews with Phil. She was doing a project which 
  involved photographing our hands a lot and then interviewing us individually 
  on 'our place in the family and views on Irish history'. She edited the recordings 
  and took the 'erms' out. Damo suggested she make files from these out-takes 
  as they were so funny. Click on a photo to play the clip. These are only 10 
  second clips from the original 3 to 4 minute out-takes. They'll take a while 
  to download but be patient...</p>
