      description: "Cully has made quite an art of walking stick making. Most of his friends have one. He made a super one with a duck's head handle. When we were on the Paris Metro with Sheila and Mike people jumped up to give him a seat. He sat there turning the head of his stick as though it were listening to the conversation.<br>Very amusing!!?? This stick was stolen in the airport at Seville"

      description: "We often see hot air balloons flying over Ross. We have a balloon pilot living opposite us and he took us up one Boxing Day. We ascended much higher than normal because one of the owners of the balloon wanted to do a stunt. When we were way above the clouds, Ian, stood on the rim of the basket and shouting 'Geronimo', fell off backwards. He seemed to fall for ages before he opened his parachute. The whole experience was magic and we finished off with a glass of Champagne because it was our wedding anniversary. "
