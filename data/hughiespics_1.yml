      description: "Taken at East Oxford Community Centre for a newspaper story on their open day - we almost lived there we practiced there so much.'The Routinies', myself, Richie Guy & Rick Taylor, got our act together here.We performed for the Oxford University Summer Balls, we did about a dozenat which there were amazing scenes of the rich at play, some ugly stuff, real debauchery, but mainly there was amazing extravagance.  Fountains of  champagne, famous bands, laser shows and the like.  One lady, the Duchess of something or other, broke a string of pearls.  I just assumed that they  were fake.  They all bounced down  some stairs and the people around started  to pick them up.  I had two hand fulls and as I gave them back I said something  like 'I hope they're not real'.  She said 'Of course they're real darling, do  you think I'd come to the ball wearing paste?'.  There must have been  thousands of pounds worth bouncing down those stairs."

Just after we came down to Swindon from the Wirral..kids would follow me around the playground and say'say something', whatever I said they would fall aboutlaughing at my accent.  On the first day, Mrs Webb, wholater became such a good friend of my mum's (Jem & Suebought her house after Jim died) was taking the class for PE.  She asked me why I wasn't getting changed, I said'because I haven't got my pumps'.  The whole class had a fit of laughter - in Swindon they are called 'daps'!"
