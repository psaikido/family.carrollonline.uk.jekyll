      description: "A picnic using the first car we ever had. Paddy gave it to us. When he came back from Africa on leave he used to buy a cheap car from an auction. He would sell it back when it was time to return. He had offered a car to us instead several times but we could not afford to run one. This time we accepted and a whole new dimension to life opened up."

When the carstarted to roll, I was helpless in the back and remember seeing Dad runninglike mad up a hill towards us.  There where a lot of drops and steep slopes about.  Jem put the handbrake back on after a short but exciting interval of mayhem!"
