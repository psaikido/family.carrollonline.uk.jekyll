      description: "Our last holiday all together. The car gave endless trouble and we were stranded on camp sites several times. We could not have been stranded in a more beautiful place. We could sit at the opening of the tent and watch avalanches sweep down off the summit of the Eiger. We would hear the sound several minutes later. The lads had a wonderful time climbing on the glacier. "
