      description: "All eight Carrolls were, unusually, in the country at the same time. We all gathered at Brendan's in Newbury where this picture was taken. Sad to say Brendan took ill earlier in the day and had to go to bed. The doctor came and gave him an injection to help him to get downstairs for this photo. You can't tell that he was being held up though!"

      description: "The garden of the house in Swindon was 100 yards long from the front of the house to the end. When we first moved in most of it was cultivated - leeks, potatoes and general veg. There were apple trees and plum trees. We eventually grassed more and more and even had a mini golf course."

Some proper climbers couldn't believe their eyes as they hurried past trying to get out of the rain!"
