      description: "Hugh making friends with Turk, the boxer dog from next door.Turk looked very fierce but was really a softy. Our cat could easily see him off the premises. We were once asked to look after him when George, from next door, had to do a night shift. He couldn\\'t find the dog as he left for work, but assured us he was not far away. We looked and looked and called and called but there was no sign of him. I had to get up in the night to get a drink for one of the children and I went out and called again. I thought I heard a faint barking. We had to ring George and admit we hadn\\'t found him.When George arrived home he was knocked over by the dog which had been locked in the house all the time.  "
