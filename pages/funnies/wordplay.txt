Each year the Washington Post's Style Invitational asks readers to take any
word, alter it by adding, subtracting or changing one letter, and supply a
new definition.
Here are the 2001 winners:

Intaxication: Euphoria at getting a tax refund, which lasts until you
realize it was your money to start with.

Reintarnation: Coming back to life as a hillbilly

Foreploy: Any misrepresentation about yourself for the purpose of getting
laid.
Giraffiti: Vandalism spray-painted very, very high

Sarchasm: The gulf between the author of sarcastic wit and the person who
doesn't get it

Inoculatte: To take coffee intravenously when you are running late
Hipatitis: Terminal coolness

Osteopornosis: A degenerate disease (this one got extra credit)
Karmageddon: It's like, when everybody is sending off all these really bad
vibes, right? And then, like, the Earth explodes and it's like, a serious
bummer

Glibido: All talk and no action

Dopeler Effect: The tendency of stupid ideas to seem smarter when they come
at you rapidly

And, the pick of the literature:
Ignoranus: A person who's both stupid and an asshole.
