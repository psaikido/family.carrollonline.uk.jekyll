      <div class="description">site I thought you might like to know that a friend asked me to look after a bird almost exactly like this one.  Within fifteen minutes as she was leaving the house the bird was dead.  It had apparently dies of shock/heart attack when it escaped when I was assuring the friend that I would be careful and attentive.  My cat took the opportunity to launch the first wave of a single-phase battle plan and moved at lightening speed across the room in a pre-emtive strike.  My AWAC system picked up an unidentified, incoming and unauthorized body in my periferal vision and I pinned the creature in full battledress/mode on the floor.  It was within sight of the target and the cat (known as 'Elliot or the 'mother of all bird-deaths') twisted in my 'Forearm of Starwars' defensive shield and sank her teeth in.  On noticing that it was the 'forearm of freedom' (for birds) she let go and not even the skin was scratched let alone blood being drawn.  The bird must have noticed this flurry of international zoological action and didn't recover.  So ends a little story.  Love Jem<br />
