  St David's holiday poems by Sarah<br>
  in the hallowed tradition of Colm
  <hr>
  We drove for hours<br>
  Mostly at 80<br>
  Until at last<br>
  A little farm gatey<br>
  Along the track<br>
  Up went the tenty<br>
  And therm-a-rests<br>
  For a sleep heaven senty
  <hr>	
  We thank the Lord for mercies small<br>
  For oceans wide and mountains tall<br>
  For foxes with their bushy tails<br>
  Who strut about our lovely Wales
  <hr>
  Be it a woman, or be it a man<br> 
  It does whatever a Sierra can<br>
  Ferry us to coastlines<br>
  Drag us to crags<br>
  So we can feel better<br>
  About boozin' and fags
