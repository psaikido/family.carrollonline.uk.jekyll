  <h3>From Anam Cara</h3>
  Though the human body is born complete in one moment, the human heart is 
  never completely born. 
  It is being birthed in every experience of your life. Everything that happens
  to you has the potential to deepen you. It brings to birth within you new territories of the heart...
  In love, you grow and come home to yourself. When you learn to love and to let your self be loved, you come home to the hearth of your own spirit. 
  You are warm and sheltered. This is the condition in which we grow...
  <br><br>
  The soul needs love as urgently as the body needs air. In the warmth of love the soul can be itself. 
  All the possibilities of your human destiny are asleep in your soul. 
  You are here to realise and honour these possibilities. When love comes into your life, 
  unrecognised dimesnsions of your destiny awaken and blossom and grow...
  <br><br>
  Perfect love casts out fear.

  <h3>From the Prophet</h3>
  Love one another, but make not a bond of love:<br>
  Let it rather be a moving sea<br>
  Between the shores of your souls.<br>
  Fill each other's cup, but drink not from one cup.<br>
  Give one another of your bread,<br>
  But eat not from the same loaf.<br>
  Sing and dance together and be joyous,<br>
  But let each one of you be alone,<br>
  Even as the strings of a lute are alone<br>
  Though they quiver with the same music.<br>
  Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping,<br>
  For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.<br>
  And stand together yet not too near together:<br>
  For the pillars of the temple stand apart,<br>
  And the oak tree and the cypress
  Grow not in each other's shadow.
